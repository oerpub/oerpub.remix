      <title>EMPTY HEADINGS CAUSE MUCH CRAZINESS</title>
      <para>This document came from cutting and pasting a section of the Life and Living document from one gdoc to the next. The cutting and pasting results in some very nasty formatting issues, including the empty headings, which were not present in the original document.</para>

    <section>
      <title>5. Light (This is a Heading 2 and the empty space below is also</title>
      <para>The stuff that follows the empty heading 2 starts with "Measure the photo-period". But instead you will see something from the end of the document that starts with "Questions". From what I can tell you lose everything from the empty heading 2 down to the next Heading 2 in the document. And then you get everything to the next emtpy heading 2 in which the proceess repeats. And you end up with multiple copies of the part that starts with "Questions". <emphasis effect="bold">EMPTY HEADING 2 BELOW followed by the text "Measure the photo-period"</emphasis></para>

      <title>6. Studying biotic factors (HEADING 2) (ends up repeated twice)</title>
      <para>If the ecosystem you have chosen covers a large area, it might be difficult to observe all the living organisms in your study.  You can get some idea of the plant and animal diversity in the ecosystem you are studying by choosing a small sample area to study.</para>
      <para>3.            Make a distribution map showing where you found the different organisms.  Give each different organism you found a code.  Draw a box like the one below to represent your grid.  Use the codes to make a map by showing where in the grid you found each organism.  You can colour code your map if you like.</para>
