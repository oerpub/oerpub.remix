We explore the use of the OpenCL programming model in porting a medical imaging pipeline for use on an AMD APU. The HPC community has been turning to heterogeneous computing for computational power with lower energy costs. AMD's APUs are a promising example of a heterogeneous architecture which bridges the gap between past homogeneity and future heterogeneity by putting a CPU and GPU on the same chip with a shared physical memory. This hybrid architecture enables optimal execution of programs that demonstrate very diverse computational characteristics.

We first approach OpenCL as GPU developers and investigate its usefulness and performance on data parallel sections of the medical imaging pipeline. We then employ the full APU by including more stages of the pipeline which demonstrate different types or levels of parallelism. We will discuss insights gained on OpenCL as a tool for heterogeneous development, including programmability and performance benefits of greater than 10x.
