0.1.4 - unreleased
------------------
- Started move towards breaking views.py into multiple modules in a views
  package. What we have so far:
  BaseHelper class as common ancestor for view classes in helper.py
  It supplies:
  - default login behaviour
  - a base macro (check templates/base.pt for more details)
  - a default macro render (check templates/macros.pt for more details)
  - abstart navigation targets.
  - methods for surfacing navigation targets to templates.
  Next steps:
  Move the rest of the module level methods into classes.
  Create a views package.
  Split views.py into multiple modules and move into view package.
  
- Added the following classes:
  PreviewView
  SummaryView
  Metadata_View
  Module_Association_View
  Modules_List_View
  Choose_Module
  Choose_Document_Source

- Add macros to macros.pt:
  modules_list
  workspace_popup
  featured_link
  featured_links_table
  back_navigation_warning
  forward_navigation_warning
  neworexisting_dialog

- Ported modal popups to bootstrap.

- Ported dialogs to bootstrap.

- All the content has been separated into individual files in the
  new views package.
